This project requires pygame, OpenGL & Pangolin to work.

I'm including a modified version of Steven Grove's Pangolin into the repository which has the relevant python bindings. You'll have to compile Pangolin's python bindings on your own machine and place them in the root directory of the project. You'll also need to add a video to the root directory as it is required as an input for the algorithm.
